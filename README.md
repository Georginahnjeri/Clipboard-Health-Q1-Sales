# Clipboard-Health-Q1-Sales
Clipboard Health is a nationwide staffing platform specializing in providing staffing to long-term care facilities. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services publish a quarterly report containing daily staffing data for all registered nursing homes in the US. I have been tasked to use the PBJ data and any other CMS data that you see fit to make a few recommendations to the Clipboard Health sales leadership team, using Q1 data.

### Objectives
The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the staffing data to identify trends, inefficiencies, and opportunities that can be leveraged to improve Clipboard Healthâ€™s staffing strategies and sales approach. 

### Analytical questions

1. Staffing Trends: What are the current staffing trends in nursing homes for Q1 2024? How do these trends vary by state, city, or county?

2. Workforce Allocation: What is the distribution of staffing hours between full-time employees and contractors? Are there any significant disparities that need to be addressed?

3. Geographical Analysis: Are there specific regions where staffing levels are consistently high or low? How can Clipboard Health tailor its offerings based on these regional differences?

4. What is the propotion of total staffing hours by role?

5. Show the distribution of RN staffing hours  across all facilities

## Recommendations
- The sales team should prioritize outreach efforts to facilities in Texas and California, as these states show higher staffing hours. Consider developing targeted marketing campaigns highlighting Clipboard Health's staffing solutions to meet their ongoing needs.
- The sales team should highlight the benefits of retaining employees, as they provide a more stable and consistent staffing solution. They should consider implementing programs that enhance job satisfaction and reduce turnover among employees.
- Since CNAs are receiving higher staffing hours,this level of staffing should be maintained.
- The sales team should consider focusing on recruiting or upselling LPN staffing solutions in areas where they have lower hours compared to CNAs,as  LPNs improve patient care and manage more complex needs.
- With RNs showing the lowest hours among the three roles, this indicates potential staffing shortages. The sales team should target areas where RN hours are low and highlight the need for increased RN staffing to ensure compliance with staffing regulations and improve patient outcomes.
