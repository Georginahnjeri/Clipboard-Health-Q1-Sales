The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services publish a quarterly report containing daily staffing data for all registered nursing homes in the US. I have been tasked to use the PBJ data and any other CMS data that you see fit to make a few recommendations to the Clipboard Health sales leadership team, using Q1 data.\n",
